<p>A strange-looking animal
was running across the open glade toward
the forest. It looked something like a
human being, but was entirely naked. Its
body, except on the palms of the hands
and soles of the feet, was covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
reddish-brown hair, but on the head it
was nearly black and long and matted;
while on the rest of the body it was short
and curled&mdash;nearly fur, in fact. Its
arms were long, reaching below the knees,
and the great toes, as it ran, stood nearly
at right angles to the others.</p>

<p>The animal carried no weapon of any
kind, if we except a club or staff broken
from a dry branch, which it seemed to
use in maintaining an upright position as
it hurried toward a large tree with
pendent branches which stood at the edge
of the forest.</p>

<p>Just as the creature reached the outer
branches, which extended nearly to the
ground, a storm, which had been rapidly
approaching, burst with great violence.
There was a loud clap of thunder, a bolt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
of lightning tore the tree to splinters, and
the animal fell to the ground, stunned by
the shock. It lay unconscious for some
time, and the thunder shower had passed,
leaving the sun shining brightly, when
it raised its head and sat up. At first it
slowly rubbed its body and head, and
then, reaching full consciousness, its attention
was attracted by a roaring and
crackling sound a short distance away.</p>

<p>The lightning had prostrated the tree
and had set fire to a mass of brush and
logs lying at its roots. The beast sprang
to its feet in astonishment and alarm.</p>

<p>The animal was one of our primitive
ancestors, and he now saw fire for the first
time.</p>

<p>As his body, chilled by the recent rain,
began to feel the warmth, he first drew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
near, but as the heat increased, he was
compelled to withdraw to a greater distance.
He gazed as if fascinated, however,
at the curious sight for a long time.</p>

<p>When it began to grow dark, he was
surprised to see that the forest for some
distance around, remained nearly as light
as day.</p>

<p>His feeble intellect, however, soon
wearied of the new sensation, and he
withdrew to an overhanging rock near-by.
He knew of a small cave at its base with a
narrow entrance, and of this he at once
took possession, rolling against the opening
some masses of stone lying near and
piling in others after he had entered,
until he had secured the opening against
any dangerous animal. He gave little
further thought to the phenomena of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

fire, for man had not yet reached a development
in intellect which permitted a
consecutive train of thought for any considerable
length of time. He slept
soundly, but when he crawled from his
refuge in the morning, the smoke still
rising from the pile of logs and brush
attracted his attention and recalled to his
mind what had occurred the evening before.
He approached the fire, which had
nearly consumed its supply of fuel, but
was smouldering still in a large decayed
log and the ends of several poles which
lay partly in a bed of glowing coals.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_015.jpg" width="371" height="495" alt="Huge tiger" />
<div class="caption">A HUGE TIGER WHICH WAS SLOWLY CREEPING UP BEHIND HIM.</div>
</div>

<p>So much was the man now interested in
this new phenomenon that he forgot for a
moment his usual caution when in the
forest, and failed to observe a huge tiger
which was slowly creeping up behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
him, and, but for the sharp sound of a
dry stick breaking under the animal's
weight, this story would have ended then
and there.</p>

<p>The man had just drawn from the fire
a burning pole and was examining with
much curiosity its glowing end, when the
sound caused him to turn, only to meet the
tiger, which had made its leap. The man
bounded to one side, and at the same time,
more by accident than design, he thrust
the burning stick against the animal's
breast. The fierce beast came against it
with such impact that it penetrated
through the skin and into the flesh. With
a scream of terror and pain and many
snarls and spits, the tiger began biting
the injured spot and then turned and fled
into the forest. Our man, who had given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
himself up for lost, stared in bewilderment
at the retreating animal and then at
the pole which had saved his life. He
thought longer and more deeply than he
had ever done before, as he stood beside
the smouldering embers. Without any
particular reason for his action, he gathered
up some of the unconsumed ends of
the branches, cast them into the coals, and
was much amused to see them ignited and
the flame renewed. It was a new plaything,
and for a long time he continued
to pile sticks upon the coals and to delight
in the bright flame, the ascending smoke
and the crackling sparks; but that he
could make any practical use of his new
discovery had not yet been suggested to
his feeble intellect.</p>

<p>Tiring at length of the sport, he realized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that he was hungry, and, turning into
the forest, he sought for food. For some
hours he roamed the hills and valleys,
striking down with his stick a small
animal which he devoured raw; finding
a few grubs under fallen logs which he
turned over; and he found also a few
berries, prematurely ripened, and finally
satisfied his ravenous appetite by filling
his stomach with buds of shrubs and some
succulent roots, which experience had
taught him were not injurious and were
at least satisfying.</p>

<p>By this time he had reached a part of
the forest in which he had been making
his home for a few weeks and, seeking
out a tree, in which he had constructed a
sort of nest with interlaced sticks and
leaves, he lay down for a nap. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
wakened late in the afternoon, climbed to
the ground and started on an aimless walk
through the forest, carrying his stick, but
no other weapon, for other weapons than
stones for throwing and sticks for striking
were then unknown.</p>

<p>Most of the people in the group to
which he belonged had short round heads,
such as scientists call brachiocephalic, but
this man was dolichocephalous, or longheaded,
and this peculiarity had given
him the name of Longhead among this
group at the few gatherings of these
people, which happened occasionally,
more by accident than design, for they
had no social organization whatever.
They had no laws; no leaders; no permanent
habitations and wore no clothing.
They slept in nests built in the branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of trees at night, or sought shelter in any
chance caves of the region through which
they roved. This had no defined boundaries
and they remained in the locality
only because they found food fairly
plentiful.</p>

<p>As yet, there was not even family organization,
for it was many ages after this
time before it dawned upon man anywhere
that the male animal played any
part in the propagation of species. To
the ordinary and usual phenomena of
nature our primitive forefathers never
gave a thought or question, but accepted
them without speculation as to their cause
or fear as to their continuance, so long as
regularity obtained. The rising and setting
of the sun were to him perfectly
natural events of daily occurrence from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
his childhood, and had so continued
during the recollection of the oldest
members of the group, and it was only
when eclipses occurred, breaking this
orderly continuity, that he felt at all
alarmed. It was natural for the moon
to shed her soft light when not obscured
by clouds, and even its waxing and waning
occasioned no alarm, for this, likewise,
had continued "since the fathers
fell asleep." There was nothing strange
about the gentle dew descending by night
or rain falling from the clouds; these he
had observed from his earliest youth; but
when the loud thunders reverberated
through the hills, and the forked lightnings
flashed athwart the sky, frequently
rending the giant trees of the forest or
bringing sudden death to a comrade, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
mysterious and dangerous display of an
unknown power, was, to him, alarming,
and he early attributed these and all other
infrequent or unaccountable phenomena
to supernatural beings with whom his
fancy peopled the hills and forests, the
rivers and the sky.</p>

<p>It was entirely natural to primitive
man that in the spring the trees and plants
should bud and send forth leaves and
blossoms, to be followed later by fruit,
"each after its kind." This, also, had
always occurred from his earliest recollection
and that of his elders, and it occasioned
no thought upon his part. It was
only when floods,
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: 'drouth' is an old variant spelling of 'drought'">drouths</ins>
 and other
calamities interfered with this orderly
sequence of events that any mystery was
presented or any thought required. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
clear that among these common and
natural occurrences, which were simply
accepted without question because they
had always happened, must be classed the
bringing forth of young by all mammals.
Man had always observed that the
females of all the animals about him
brought forth young, "each after its
kind." This was to be expected and gave
him no surprise, nor, in the then condition
of his intellect, did it give rise to a
thought as to its cause. Likewise, his
own womankind gave birth to young,
from time to time, just as did the other
animals, and there was no cause for speculation
or thought in regard to this; the
occurrence was too common to be a mystery.</p>

<p>There being then no knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fatherhood, there were no fathers, and
for many generations no relatives were
known except in the female line. Consequently,
there was no family hearthstone;
no paternal love; no marriage.
The relations of the sexes was purely
physical and were generally indiscriminate,
as opportunity might afford; but
doubtless, with some, this companionship
was continued for a longer or shorter
period, as circumstances or congeniality
might induce.</p>

<p>In these ages, and they were long ones
among some peoples, it is obvious that
there could have been no such emotion as
paternal love, for no man even suspected
that he was a father. No man experienced
the exquisite pleasure of hearing
the first cry of his first-born child; no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man heard "Dada," from infant lips.
No man assisted in the support of his children
or took part in their care, except unconsciously
as he aided in the maintenance
of the children of the group or
tribe; no man cared more for the mother
of his children than he did for any other
woman who might attract his fancy or
passion. Above all, the men and women
of that long epoch were strangers to the
sacred companionship, the life-long attachment
and communion of souls with
mutual interests which attach to the true
marriage of to-day. The children were
the common care of the group or tribe;
the boys that they might grow up to be
hunters and warriors, and the girls that
they might contribute to the sensual enjoyment
of the men, or, if it pleased the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
spirits, or stars, or some other supernatural
agency, might become mothers for
the perpetuation of the tribe. In times
of extreme danger, famine or privation,
or when too feeble to follow the migrations
of the group, the babies, especially
the female ones, were ruthlessly abandoned
to wild beasts or slaughtered outright.
There existed, doubtless, the
mother instinct which prompts females,
even among the lower animals, to care
for and defend their offspring, but it certainly
fell far short of the mother love
among civilized peoples.</p>

<p>After wandering aimlessly a number
of miles, Longhead encountered a female
of his own species who was not altogether
unknown to him. They had met occasionally
at the infrequent gatherings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the people who inhabited that part of the
forest, and on one or two occasions had
remained together for a few days in that
anomalous companionship which took the
place of marriage in those far-off days.
There was no kiss, caress or other sign of
affection or pleasure; the pair merely
gave each other a friendly grin and
grunted in a satisfactory tone. Words
were scarce in the vocabulary of the
people of that epoch, and they communicated
with each other largely by means
of signs, gesticulation and pantomime.
The woman could not have been called
handsome, according to our ideas of
beauty. She, too, was naked and hairy,
but the hair on her head was longer and
less matted than on that of the man, and
was held back from her face by being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
drawn behind the ears with a strip of
bark twisted about her head to keep it
somewhat in that condition. Her body
was smaller than that of Longhead; but
her limbs were slender and ungainly and
her stomach also protruded, in consequence
of the quantities of coarse vegetable
food required to sustain life. By an
accident in childhood, she had lost one of
her front teeth, and on this account, she
was known as Broken Tooth.</p>

<p>The woman soon gave Longhead to
understand that she was hungry. The
protective, or probably, the sexual instinct,
prompted him to act as a provider,
and he offered to assist her in a search for
food. Together they roamed, finding
here a few grubs and there a juicy root,
and finally the man killed a small animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
with his club, which they shared, Longhead
tearing it in pieces with his hands
and teeth and throwing small pieces to
Broken Tooth, which he admiringly
watched her devour. Her appetite
finally satisfied, she lay back in the sunshine
against the roots of a tree, closed
her eyes in great contentment, and began
a conversation with her companion in the
few words then constituting the human
vocabulary. She recalled their last meeting
and asked why she had not seen him
at any of the gatherings of the group
since. He told her that in consequence
of the jealousy of one of the giants of the
group to which they both belonged, who
had resented his attentions to one of the
females of his harem, he had become
involved in a fight with the giant in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which he had been beaten nearly to
death, and that, fearing to remain with
his fellows, as well as on account of his
serious injuries, he had retired to a distant
part of the forest where he had
found sufficient food and had recovered
his strength. He told her that he had
rather enjoyed his isolation and, had
present company been with him in his
forced retirement, he would have been
entirely content. At this statement, the
woman merely gave an incredulous sniff.</p>

<p>The man then related numerous encounters
with wild animals, in which, of
course, he had come off successfully&mdash;and
just here he recollected his strange
experience with the fire and his encounter
with the tiger. With great
truthfulness, and as much detail as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
vocabulary permitted, he told her what
had occurred to him the evening before
and that very morning. How, seeking
for refuge from a storm, he had been suddenly
stricken unconscious, by what
means he did not know; and the strange
sight he had witnessed on recovery. He
told her, also, of his adventure with the
tiger that morning and its discomfiture.
Broken Tooth laughed long and loudly
at this and was wholly incredulous.
Such a thing had never happened before,
and consequently could not have
happened now. She asked him what
kind of a weed he had been eating, and
said she was not born yesterday to believe
such nonsense. This led to quite a
discussion, the man insisting upon the
reality of his experiences and the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ridiculing the whole narrative as impossible.
The colloquy finally ended by her
asking him to conduct her to the place
where he claimed such wonderful things
had happened, that she might see if anything
remained there to confirm his absurd
story. Longhead assented and, as
it was not far distant, they arrived at the
locality a little before dark. The fire still
smouldered in the decayed log and
numerous sticks still smoked at their
ends. Mindful of his morning's amusement,
Longhead gathered a number of
the burning poles, placed their glowing
ends together and threw on them some
dry leaves and twigs. In a moment a
column of smoke began to ascend, followed
soon by a tongue of bright flame
and many rising and glowing sparks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
One of these Broken Tooth caught in her
hand, but dropped it with an exclamation
of pain. "If a small one hurts so
much, I don't wonder your tiger fled
when you thrust a large one against his
breast," she said.</p>

<p>Long they played with the fire, throwing
upon it sticks and dry branches, and
the woman clapped her hands and
screamed with delight at each succeeding
shower of sparks.</p>

<p>When at length night came on and the
darkness made the firelight more brilliant,
the man piled a large number of
sticks on the fire to show how the forest
was lighted up; but finally both became
weary of the sport, and then he told her
of the cave near-by&mdash;just large enough
for two&mdash;and invited her to share it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
with him for the night. She consented,
and as they were about to start, the man,
without any thought of the effect, gathered
up four or five of the sticks with
live coals at the end and placed them together.
These he waved in the air to
amuse the woman with the flying sparks,
as they passed along, she still screaming
at each successive sparkle, until suddenly
a bright flame shot up and, by accident,
like many other valuable discoveries, a
torch was invented. By its light they
easily made their way to the rocky platform
in front of the cave sheltered by the
overhanging rock, and when Longhead
cast down the torch Broken Tooth placed
the ends of the burning sticks together as
she had seen him do, and again the flame
shot up. The new experience was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
delightful to be given up, and, at the
woman's suggestion, they gathered large
armfuls of dry branches and some heavy
logs which lay scattered about near the
platform, which they piled up and from
time to time added to the fire.</p>

<p>The night was cool, but as they sat back
against the wall of rock under the
sloping cliff to watch the blaze and flying
sparks, a pleasant warmth, new to
their experience, pervaded their bodies,
and they gave themselves up to the
luxury of the sensation.</p>

<p>The fire roared and blazed merrily,
Broken Tooth shouted in glee, and Longhead
began to think, in a slow ponderous
way, that this new agent in his life might
do much for his comfort if it could be
perpetuated, but his mental power was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
too limited to suggest any method for
this.</p>

<p>Their shouts and laughter had attracted
the attention of the wild animals,
and all at once Broken Tooth saw two
glowing eyes and the crouching form of
a great tiger almost at the edge of the
platform. Longhead caught sight of it
at the same moment, and with a yell of
fear each scrambled for the narrow entrance
of the cave. Broken Tooth,
lighter of form and quicker of movement,
reached it a moment the soonest,
but no promptings of sex, gallantry or
politeness prevented Longhead from
throwing her roughly to one side while
he attained the coveted shelter. Once
within, he began to fill the entrance with
stones, leaving his companion to the fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
which he supposed had already befallen
her, when, greatly to his surprise, she
tumbled in unhurt. Filling the entrance
so that it would not admit the body of the
tiger, they peered together through the
openings and saw the disappointed
animal pacing back and forth just at the
edge of the semi-circle of brilliant light
made by the fire. Long they watched
the baffled beast, and at first they were
unable to understand why the animal did
not approach the entrance and attempt to
remove the stones and secure his prey.
At length Broken Tooth said: "I believe
he is afraid of the fire." She did not, of
course, use the word "fire;" she probably
said "brightness," or some equivalent
word, if they had one. Longhead agreed
that this might be the case, and together<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
they watched the animal with great interest.
Finally Longhead, emboldened
by the tiger's hesitation, removed one of
the stones, and, protruding his head,
shouted in derision at his ancient enemy.
The animal, whose rage or hunger made
him momentarily forget his fear, made a
dash toward the cave, but, when he came
within the bright light and felt the heat
of the fire, he retreated precipitately.
Longhead finally crawled outside and
Broken Tooth soon followed him. They
taunted the great cat with the vilest words
they knew; threw stones at it, and simply
revelled in their new sensation of safety.
Here was Old Saber-Tooth, the one
animal of all others whose vicinage carried
terror wherever he went, at bay at
last. For a while the animal would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
make dashes toward them, when Broken
Tooth would tumble into the cave and
Longhead draw near the entrance, ready
for instant retreat to safety; but each
time the fear of the fire sent the tiger
back beyond the charmed circle of its
light, where it gave vent to its disappointment
in savage growls and spittings. At
length, wearied by the unprofitable labor,
and awed by the strange light and heat,
the beast disappeared; its snarls and
growls grew fainter in the distance and
ceased to be heard. Saber-Tooth had at
last found something he feared, and man
a protector.</p>

<p>Delighted with this new feeling of security
from danger in the night, the man
and woman sat long before the cheerful
blaze and enjoyed its grateful warmth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
They agreed that wild animals were
afraid of this new agent, and if they
could always have its protection they
would have nothing to fear from them;
but to their weak intellects no thought
of an attempt to perpetuate the fire was
suggested.</p>

<p>When their fuel was exhausted and
nothing but a bed of glowing coals remained,
they retired to the cave, carefully
closing the entrance against the possible
return of the tiger or the attack of
some other animal, for they realized that
the fire, being now nearly out, they could
no longer depend upon it for protection.</p>

<p>Late in the morning Longhead and
Broken Tooth emerged from the cave.
The fire was out and the ashes cold.
When they thought of the pleasurable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
warmth it had produced and the protection
it had afforded they indulged in some
expressions of regret that it was gone,
and then thought no more about it. They
soon made their way to the place of the
smouldering log, but it was now nearly
consumed. Directly the woman noticed
two or three tiny threads of smoke, and
on investigation they found that some dry
excrescences, which we call "punk," had
fallen away from the burning log and
that on one side of each was a small spark.
Broken Tooth took up one of these and,
noting the white ash so like the down on
certain plants which she had often blown
away in sport, she blew upon it as she
held it in her hand, and was delighted
to see the spark spread and glow afresh.
Longhead, too, picked up a piece of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
lighted punk and, after blowing upon it
for a few minutes, dropped it carelessly
at his feet, where it fell upon some dry
rotten wood and leaves. Without noticing
this, he watched the amusement of his
companion as she made the sparks fly
from the piece she held, and then, suddenly,
with a yell of pain, he jumped
aside and hopped about on one foot, holding
the other in his hand. The rotten
wood and leaves upon which he had
dropped the punk had ignited and the
fire had reached his foot. He now understood
the defeat of the tiger the morning
before, and had ocular and painful
demonstration of the fact that punk will
retain fire, at least for a few hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption">AFTER SOME VIGOROUS BLOWING, PRODUCED FLAME.</div>
</div>

<p>Longhead now seemed to wake up; at
last he had an idea, and he talked it over
with the woman as they slowly returned
to the cave platform, each carrying a
piece of the lighted punk. Once there,
the man sought for dry, rotten wood and
small twigs, which they piled upon the
punk and, after some vigorous blowing,
produced flame.</p>

<p>An idea was born; a discovery was
made; the greatest in all time. Broken
Tooth remained to maintain the fire by
putting on fresh fuel, while Longhead
carried armfuls of sticks and logs from
the forest, together with pieces of punk
for future use. The punk he piled at the
cave entrance to keep it dry, and man was
now master of fire, the most beneficent of
nature's gifts. Thenceforth it only remained
that a plentiful supply of dry
fuel and punk should be maintained at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the cave, and their comfort and safety
were assured.</p>

<p>Their delight at their mutual discovery&mdash;for
Longhead insisted that if Broken
Tooth had not blown upon the punk for
amusement, he would not have discovered
a method for the preservation of the
fire&mdash;drew the two closer together as
having a great secret in common. The
necessity that the fire be supplied with
fuel that it might be kept alive, and that
fresh fire might occasionally be applied
to the pieces of punk, suggested that one
should remain for that purpose; and
when Longhead proposed that the two
should remain permanently together,
the woman to keep the fire alive while
the man sought for food for both,
Broken Tooth agreed at once; and thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
came about the first union resembling
marriage in which the man became the
provider and the woman the home-keeper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<span class="smaller">WEAPONS&mdash;COOKED FOOD&mdash;COMPANIONSHIP</span></h2>


<p>For some months the man and woman
maintained their residence in the cave,
uninterrupted by any visits from other
human inhabitants of the forest. Daily
Longhead went forth in search of food,
which he brought to the cave and they
shared it together. Sometimes there was
plenty, but often their meals were scanty,
as the only weapons then known were
stones and clubs. Broken Tooth aided
to some extent, by searching a piece of
low moist ground not far from the cave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for such roots and tubers as were palatable,
and altogether, they managed to
sustain life as well as before their union,
but the woman never ventured far from
the platform for fear that by some accident
their precious fire should go out.</p>

<p>Every night the fire blazed merrily
upon the platform, fed with dry branches
and large sticks, which it was the task of
the woman to procure during the day.
Frequently they saw wild animals in the
forest at night or heard their growls as
they prowled in the surrounding thickets,
but never after their experience with the
tiger the first night of their fire, did one
venture within the charmed circle of the
light made by the flames.</p>

<p>Sometimes when it rained or the
weather was cold, and sufficient food remained
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
over from the night before, Longhead
lingered about the cave and platform
all day, enjoying the warmth and
comfort of the fire, and on these occasions
the couple talked much of the benefits
of their new acquisition.</p>

<p>One day Broken Tooth said: "What
shall we say if some of the people wander
this way and find us? What shall we tell
them about how we came in possession of
this new comfort?" Then they talked
about this long and earnestly. They had
no desire to benefit their fellows by
sharing with them their accidental discovery,
for man was yet a purely selfish
animal, and there was no organized society
of any kind; but they both recognized
the fact that when others became acquainted
with its benefits, they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
soon acquire the fire, by force if necessary,
and that their own lives would stand for
nothing, should they resist. They felt
sure that the matter could not long be
concealed from other members of their
group, for the first hunter who should
wander to that part of the forest would
smell the smoke and would investigate.
It was finally concluded that, as they did
not themselves know how the fire had
originated in the heap of logs and brush,
they would say Longhead himself had
produced it in a mysterious manner,
which they dare not reveal for fear it
might be taken from them.</p>

<p>That they might not be observed in the
mornings kindling the fire with punk and
tinder, and their secret be thus exposed,
it was agreed that all the punk should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
kept in the cave, the fires lighted there,
and only brought out on the platform
after the sticks were ablaze.</p>

<p>Every night two pieces of punk were
ignited and laid carefully up on a small
natural projecting shelf in the cave.
They used two pieces, fearing that by
some accident one might become extinguished.
The fact is, this very thing did
happen once. The lighted punk had been
laid back against the rear wall of the platform
when they went to bed, but a violent
storm had come on in the night and the
rain had been driven in so that the punk
was wet and the spark gone in the morning.
Their precious fire was only saved
by Broken Tooth finding a tiny spark on
the under side of a log which the water
had not happened to reach. They had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
been greatly alarmed, and so two pieces
had been thereafter lighted and both
taken into the cave to avoid such another
mishap.</p>

<p>This peaceful enjoyment of their new-found
happiness and companionship had
continued for some months, when one
evening a small animal which they were
about to tear to pieces for their evening
meal, fell into a large bed of burning
coals on the platform. Longhead was
about to recover it when Broken Tooth,
whose sense of smell may have been more
acute, said: "Wait a minute; what is
that delicious smell?"</p>

<p>Up to this time they had still continued
to eat their food raw, and there had been
nothing to suggest to the mind of either
that it would be better if exposed to heat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Now they continued for some minutes to
inhale the new and agreeable odor, but
it had the effect to make Longhead ravenously
hungry, and he soon drew the
animal from the coals with a long stick.
When he began to tear it the hot carcass
burned his fingers, which alarmed him at
first, but the demands of his appetite must
be satisfied, and, tearing it in pieces, he
divided with the woman. At first they
both tasted gingerly and were a little
afraid of the unaccustomed heat, but before
either had finished the first morsel
their pleasure was evident. They devoured
the whole of the animal, and declared
it the finest eating they had ever
experienced. Two or three other small
animals lay beside the fire and they decided
to repeat the course. Both had ob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>served
that the portions of the first animal
which had been most exposed to the heat
had been made tender and more appetizing,
and, on the suggestion of Broken
Tooth, a long slender stick was thrust
through an animal, which was by this
means held over the hottest part of the
bed of coals by Longhead, who turned it
from time to time, that all parts might be
thoroughly cooked. This was so much
better than the first that their appetites
returned with renewed vigor, and when
the second animal had been eaten, they
again repeated the courses until all the
food on hand had been devoured. They
both declared that roasted meat was far
superior to raw, and agreed that this
should be the method of preparing meat
for the future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>One day when Broken Tooth returned
from the swamp with some wild carrots
and other roots, she thrust one into a pile
of hot ashes and burning coals, merely as
an experiment. She left it there while she
collected some fuel and replenished the
fire, and when she drew it out and tasted
it she was pleased to find that roots also
were much improved by cooking. When
Longhead returned in the evening he was
treated to a surprise&mdash;supper of two
courses, broiled wood-rat and roasted
carrot.</p>

<p>Everything to be used for food was
thereafter submitted to the cooking test,
and, whenever broiling or roasting in the
ashes seemed to improve the taste of any
article of food, this was adopted.</p>

<p>Longhead and Broken Tooth now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
found themselves really caring for each
other and each sought to do things to
please the other. As far as they were concerned,
the old selfishness was now gone.
Their close companionship around the
fire alone during the evenings; its cheerful
light and gay sparkle, its warmth and
comfort tended to promote conversation
and they found themselves talking more
than they had ever before in their lives.
They even coined a few words to express
their new experiences and feelings.
Longhead would relate in detail the
hunting adventures of the day and
Broken Tooth would recount her own experiences
in search of roots and eggs.</p>

<p>Both thoroughly enjoyed their new life
at the fire-cave; indeed, it seemed to
them they had never really lived before.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Nearly every day Longhead would go
into the forest in search of small animals
for food. In his absence Broken Tooth
first collected sufficient fuel to keep the
fire alive for another twenty-four hours,
then she would visit the low ground for
roots and tubers, eggs and nuts, for since
they had been experimenting with roasting,
they had discovered that a number of
roots which had been rejected as bitter
and unpalatable, when raw, were much
improved by roasting, and these had been
added to the bill of fare. Broken Tooth
had found nesting places of the waterfowl
which frequented the swamp. Her
first experiment in roasting eggs had been
a partial failure. She placed a couple of
eggs in the hot ashes, noticing at the time
that the shell of one was cracked; soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
there was an explosion and the egg with
the sound shell was destroyed. Thereafter
she made a small hole in each for
the escape of the steam and all went well.
Her worst trouble with eggs was the want
of a receptacle for transporting them to
the fire-cave, for she wore not even an
apron.</p>

<p>When evening began to draw near,
Broken Tooth found herself looking
often into the forest and wishing for
Longhead's return. She sometimes
feared a savage beast might have killed
him. This was a new feeling for her.
In the former life she had never cared
for any one or cared particularly to see
others. One evening when the man
finally appeared, she ran into the forest
to meet him and put her arms around his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
neck. Longhead looked at her in some
surprise and then returned the caress,
and they walked arm in arm to the platform.
That evening they both talked a
great deal, and finally Broken Tooth
said: "I wonder what has come over
both of us. Even when together for a
short time in the old days, we spoke but
seldom. I wonder if it is the fire."</p>

<p>It was indeed the fire, with its warmth
and cheer, so different from the old days
when each had shivered in the fork of a
tree or had spent the night in a dark and
noisome cavern. Neither understood the
nature of the change which was being
wrought in them, but if it was not yet
real marriage, it was at least the germ
which in the long succeeding ages has
developed into real marriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>One morning a cold rain was falling
and Longhead sat long before the blazing
fire, loth to leave the comfort he found
there for the chilly and dripping forest.
He drew a long slender stick from the
fire and began to observe its glowing end.
As the ashes accumulated and hid the red
coal, he blew them away. After a few
minutes, the fire on the stick went out and
the man, picking up a piece of stone, began
idly and without purpose to scrape
away the black or charred portion of the
end. When he reached the unburned
wood, he found it very hard and as he
continued to scrape, he finally brought
the stick to a very sharp point. He felt
this and thought it might be very good for
killing small animals, so when he finally
started out for his day's search for food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
he took it with him. It was fortunate he
did so, for late in the afternoon as he was
turning toward home, after an unsuccessful
hunt, a pack of wild dogs attacked
him. So close were they upon him before
he was aware, that the leader sprang
at him to pull him down just before he
reached a tree in which he was about to
take refuge. In defense, he thrust the
sharpened stick at the beast with all his
might. It passed clear through the body
of the dog, which fell dead and was
quickly devoured by its fellows, while
the man scrambled to safety. When
Longhead climbed down, after the dogs
had dispersed, he secured the sharpened
stick, and it was with a new feeling of
safety he moved through the forest, spear
in hand; for a spear had been invented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
A few days later he even ventured to attack
a wild dog he found separated from
the pack; a thing he never would have
done when armed with only a club or
stone. He killed the animal and carried
it in triumph to the fire-cave, for it was
the first time, to his knowledge, a man,
ever, single-handed, had killed so large
an animal of a ferocious kind. Its roasted
flesh supplied the man and woman food
for several days.</p>

<p>One day, when kindling a fire on the
platform, the woman was too indolent to
remove some small boulders from the
spot where she desired to make the fire,
so she piled the fuel over them and was
surprised to find that the fire kindled
more readily and burned better on account
of the fuel being raised from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
ground, and thereafter, three or four
stones were used to support the sticks.
One morning, after the fire had burned
for some time and the stones were red
hot, a smart shower came up. The fire
was too far under the slope of the shelving
rock to be directly affected, but as it
continued to rain for some time, a small
pool accumulated on top of the rock,
which finally worked its way through
the bed of leaves that had dammed its
progress and, all at once, it poured over
the face of the rock in a small column and
fell directly upon one of the red-hot
stones in the fire-place. The stone was a
large nodule of flint; there was an immediate
explosion, a dense cloud of steam
and ashes arose, and the alarmed owners
of the cave rushed for safety to its depths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
When all was quiet they emerged to find
that one of the stones which supported
the sticks had disappeared. Instead
of the stone, however, there were
numerous sharp flakes of flint scattered
about, which Longhead first discovered
when he cut his foot by stepping
on one.</p>

<p>With much curiosity, the man examined
the flake which had injured him,
then picking up the carcass of a small
animal lying near, he found that he could
cut it with the flake. He now carefully
gathered up all the flakes he could find
and carried them into the cave. When
he returned from his day's hunt in the
evening, he brought with him a long,
slender, dry stick which he rubbed and
polished with a flake until perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
smooth; then, with some fibrous roots,
he bound the longest and sharpest of his
flakes at the end of the pole, and the next
day carried this with him to the forest instead
of the fire-hardened wooden spear.
Later, he discovered that narrow strips of
rawhide were better than roots for tying
on a flake, and, after many years of progress,
the long tendons of large animals
were substituted as still better for the purpose.</p>

<p>Longhead and his new deadly weapon
had numerous encounters with small
animals, in each of which he found his
new spear superior to anything he had yet
tried, and this gave him still greater confidence
in himself. He no longer sneaked
through the forest half bent to the ground
and fearing nearly every animal he might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
meet, but went with head erect and a
more fearless step.</p>

<p>A few days later, while pursuing some
half-grown wild pigs, and when they
were about to plunge into a den in the
rocks, he threw his spear at the last one,
in disappointment. To his surprise, it
passed clear through the animal, killing
it at once. He carried the pig to the cave
and that night sat long before the fire in
deep thought. Finally, he selected a long
and thin fragment of flint, rather broader
than those he had used for the spear,
wrapped some small roots about it at one
end to protect his hand, and he had a
knife&mdash;the first one in the world. The
next morning he tied a strip of bark
around his waist to support the knife,
and when he returned in the evening he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
brought with him several dry and slender
sticks shorter than his spear and proceeded
to bind a sharp splinter of flint to
each. Thereafter, he always carried one
of these short ones in addition to his long
spear, and thus a javelin was invented.
He practiced throwing this at every
animal he saw, and, indeed, at other objects,
and soon became quite expert in its
use. He found, too, that it was now
much easier to keep the larder well supplied.</p>

<p>In his wanderings, Longhead one day
approached quite near the locality in
which he had formerly resided with the
group, and where he had received the terrible
beating which had made him an
exile. He gnashed his teeth when he
thought of the man who had vented his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
jealous rage upon him and was wondering
in his mind how he could obtain revenge.
At that instant he turned around
a point of rocks and found himself face to
face with the giant himself. The fellow
was all of a head taller and at least fifty
pounds heavier than Longhead; his
strength was immense and his temper
ferocious. By reason of his size and
fierce temper, as well as the surly grunts
he generally used instead of words, he
was known among the people of the
group as the Bear. He was a veritable
tyrant and most of the others were practically
his slaves. When Bear saw a man
or woman with food he wanted, he
reached for it with a roar, and it was at
once given up or its owner was beaten
nearly to death. He had a large number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the women so terrified that they did
not dare to associate with the other men;
these he kept near himself and compelled
them to supply him with food. Longhead
had once persuaded one of these
women to accompany him on a trip in
search of food. They were absent several
days, and on his return, Bear had given
him the beating. Bear knew him at once,
and with a howl of rage and uplifted
club, rushed upon him. Longhead was
terribly frightened, and for a moment
forgot all about his spear, but in a second
he recalled the fate of the pig and other
animals and, with all his strength, he
threw his javelin at the hairy breast of
the advancing enemy, now but a pace or
two distant. It went nearly through his
body and, with a yell of pain, the giant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
threw up his hands and fell to the ground.
He tried to pull the weapon from his
body, and failing in this, writhed in
agony for a few moments and then lay
perfectly still. He was dead, and Longhead
looked with wonder and awe at his
victim.</p>

<p>Fighting was not uncommon among
the men of that period, but being without
dangerous weapons, the fights had generally
resulted in one or both the combatants
being more or less seriously but not
dangerously injured, and this was the first
time Longhead had ever seen one human
being killed by another. Deaths he had,
of course, known, but they had been from
disease, accident or wild animals.</p>

<p>He now heard some of the people approaching,
and drawing his javelin from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
the corpse, he concealed himself near-by
to observe the effect when they should
discover the body. There were three of
the party, and at first they thought Bear
asleep and shouted to arouse him, but
when they discovered the blood and the
hole in his breast, they perceived that he
was dead.</p>

<p>Longhead in hiding heard no expressions
of sorrow or regret, for, to tell the
truth, Bear was no favorite with the
group. His immense size and irascible
disposition had made him a bully, and
there were few who had not been beaten
by him at some time; therefore, the remarks
overheard by the man in hiding
were rather to the effect that the finders
were well enough pleased, but they expressed
great wonder at the wound and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
could not conceive what animal had
caused it, especially as there were no
marks of teeth or claws or any other
wounds on the body. They picked up
the corpse, however, and started with it
toward the late habitation of the giant.</p>

<p>Longhead left his retreat and proceeded
thoughtfully toward the fire-cave.
His revenge was gratified and he felt
happy on that account, but the wonderful
character of his weapon was beginning
to dawn upon his dull intelligence,
and he no longer feared man or beast.
He dimly recognized that with such a
weapon a small man was the equal of a
giant.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<span class="smaller">GERMS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION</span></h2>


<p>After several months' residence at
the fire-cave, during which none of their
former neighbors had appeared in the
vicinity, Longhead and Broken Tooth
were seated at their fire one evening enjoying
a hearty meal of cooked flesh and
roasted tubers and eggs. The man had,
thanks to his javelin, brought home all
the meat he could carry, the fire blazed
merrily and they were enjoying themselves
to the utmost when they were
greeted by human voices from some trees
near the cave. It appeared that a couple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
of their old neighbors had been hunting
in that part of the forest and, night coming
on, they had sought safety from dangerous
animals by climbing a tree. This
happened to be so near the cave that they
caught sight of the light made by the fire,
and the strange sight excited their
curiosity. At first, they were greatly
alarmed, never having seen fire before,
but curiosity soon overcame fear, and,
passing from tree to tree, they cautiously
approached the platform. When quite
near they recognized Longhead and
Broken Tooth as old acquaintances and
called out to them. They were at once
invited to come down, but declined at
first, being afraid of the strange light,
but, being assured by the man and woman
that there was no danger, they soon descended,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
and very gingerly and with
many pauses, after much encouragement,
approached the platform.</p>

<p>The genial warmth of the fire pleased
them greatly and they asked Longhead
what it was and where it came from. He
made vague and mysterious answers and
gave them little satisfaction. He told
them, however, that the savage animals
were afraid of the light and would not
come near it, relating their adventure
with Saber-Tooth their first night at the
cave, and he assured them that if the fire
was kept alive by a supply of fuel, one
could sleep in the open forest at night
without danger, and showed them the
effect of putting on fresh fuel. He invited
them to remain upon the platform
for the night, informing them that but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
one must sleep at a time, the other remaining
awake to supply the fire with
wood, of which he showed them the pile
and instructed them to put but little on
at a time, that it might not be exhausted
before daylight.</p>

<p>There was a goodly supply of meat at
the cave, for the man had been successful
in the day's hunt, and he and Broken
Tooth now proceeded to cook some of it
over the coals. When it was well done,
they offered some to their guests. At first
they were afraid of it and declined to
taste until their hosts had eaten some, but,
after the first taste they devoured it ravenously
and expressed great surprise and
satisfaction at the improvement over raw
meat.</p>

<p>At a late hour Longhead and Broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Tooth retired to their cave, leaving their
guests seated at the fire. They both remained
awake all night, replenishing the
fire from time to time, as they had been
instructed. They thoroughly enjoyed the
new sensation of light and warmth as
compared with the dark and chilly
refuge of a tree-top, and they talked
much of this new element and its mysterious
character.</p>

<p>When Longhead and Broken Tooth
emerged from the cave in the morning,
their visitors were gone, and so was the
last scrap of meat, for their guests had
enjoyed the unusual hospitality to the
fullest extent, by spending the night in
roasting and eating until gorged, and had
taken their departure as soon as it was
fully daylight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>It chanced that they returned to their
group of people on the day of a general
gathering, and over and over again they
told the marvels they had witnessed the
night before. Most of their auditors set
them down as first-class liars, and not a
few told them plainly what they thought
of the story. On the second day, however,
three of the group agreed to accompany
them to the fire-man's cave and
verify the matter. The five arrived near
the platform about dusk, and brought
with them several small animals they had
killed on the way. As dark was coming
on, the fire burned brightly on the rocky
bench in front of the cave. The two who
had been visitors before advanced boldly,
but when they neared the light, the others
promptly climbed trees to view the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
strange sight from a position of safety.
They saw Longhead and Broken Tooth
seated by the fire, and, when their companions
reached the platform, they saw
them welcomed and seated. These called
to them to come on as there was nothing
to fear, and finally, they climbed down
and cautiously approached. Their surprise
was great and their satisfaction unbounded
when they felt the warmth; and
now the first comers suggested a trial of
the new method of preparing food. Here
a new surprise awaited them, for Longhead
and Broken Tooth each produced
a flint knife and proceeded to cut the
animals in small pieces instead of tearing
them,&mdash;a proceeding which the new-comers
watched with great interest, for
they had never before seen a knife.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Longhead gave each a piece and showed
how to hold it over the hottest part of the
burning coals, and to turn it that all parts
might be cooked and not scorched.</p>

<p>They took the delight of children in a
new game, and besides, they were hungry
from their long tramp, and the feast
lasted until all the meat and roasted roots
had been disposed of, many questions being
asked, however, during the progress
of the meal about the origin of the fire.
These the man and woman answered
mysteriously, and finally retired to the
cave, leaving their guests more mystified
than ever.</p>

<p>The visitors remained awake most of
the night, one or two sleeping while the
others kept the fire supplied with fuel.
It happened, also, that a couple of tigers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
approached the light near enough to be
seen by them, but sneaked off, afraid of
the strange sight.</p>

<p>This time they all remained until the
man and woman arose in the morning,
and then insisted that Longhead should
tell them where the fire came from and
how they could procure it for the benefit
of the group. He answered as mysteriously
as before, and pointed to the sky
as the place from whence it came; but
he gave them to understand that he controlled
the mysterious agent; that there
were plenty of caves in the ravine near-by,
and if the group would take these for
their habitations, he would not object to
supplying them with the fire; and he
showed them how it might be conveyed
to a considerable distance by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
torches. He was careful, however, not
to say anything about its preservation by
means of the punk, and he declined to
give any explanation in regard to the
flint knives with which the meat had
been cut.</p>

<p>Since he had become acquainted with
the use of fire, Longhead's intellect had
expanded rapidly, and he now began to
have a vague idea that he could make use
of these secrets to his own personal advantage.</p>

<p>On their return to the group, the party
reported that all the first two had said
about the fire was true and the half had
not been told. They enlarged upon the
appetizing method of preparing food by
roasting, and the warmth and comfort of
the heat, to say nothing of the terror in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
which the fire was held by the ferocious
animals.</p>

<p>They told of the caves in the vicinity
of the fire-man's habitation and his offer
to supply them all with fire, and proposed
an immigration to the locality, that
all might enjoy this new agent for man's
comfort.</p>

<p>Most of the group agreed to the proposition,
and the next day removed with
their few belongings and located themselves
in the caves of the ravine; but a
few conservative old fellows said they
would have nothing to do with such unnatural
and mysterious business; and as
to roasting meat, it was surely intended
that it should be eaten raw, else why were
they furnished with hands to tear and
teeth to chew, and besides, had not their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
fathers always eaten their meat raw?
For their part, they would remain at the
old locality and follow the old and tried
methods, at least, until they should see if
any harm befell the immigrants on account
of the innovation.</p>

<p>By the time the procession of emigrants
had arrived at the fire-cave, Longhead
and Broken Tooth had determined
upon their own course of action, and
when the new-comers had selected their
respective caves and came to be instructed
in the use of fire, Longhead told
each that as this mysterious agent was his
property and he alone could produce or
destroy it, he would require of each that
he should bring an armful of fuel or a
present of food when he came for fire;
and further, that if the fire on any hearth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should go out, it should not be rekindled
with that of a neighbor, but by a torch
lighted at his own central fire; and he
threatened that if these rules should be
violated, he would at once extinguish all
the fires and retire to a distant part of the
forest, leaving them in their former condition.</p>

<p>So beneficial did the people by this
time believe the fire to be, that they all
readily agreed to his terms, and scattered
through the forest to secure armfuls of
fuel with which to purchase the blessing,
except a few who happened to have food
to exchange. As each threw down his
contribution he received a lighted torch
and was given instruction how to kindle
his fire, and, by the time it became dark,
the whole ravine was brilliantly illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
and merry with the shouts of old
and young as they gathered for the first
time around hearthstones and enjoyed
light and heat.</p>

<p>Those who had visited the fire-cave
before the immigration, proceeded at
once to roast their meat and tubers, and
the others imitated them, though a few
concluded to eat theirs raw until they
might see if the new method was injurious
to those who tried it. The first touch
of the hot meat with lips or fingers
brought exclamations of surprise or fear
from some, but, on the whole, cooking
was voted a success and was thereafter
universally practiced.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<span class="smaller">CO-OPERATION</span></h2>


<p>A few days after the arrival of the
colony of settlers at the fire-cave, the
conservatives of the group who had remained
at the old home could no longer
control their curiosity, and so, one afternoon
they approached the vicinity of the
new settlement, after cautiously reconnoitering
from the tree-tops. When discovered,
they were cordially invited to
approach, for the old selfishness and exclusiveness
seemed to melt away under
the influence of fire and the companionship
it inculcated, and they were soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
enjoying for the first time roasted carrots
and broiled meat. They soon lost
their shyness and fear under the new
conditions, and remained permanent
denizens of the settlement.</p>

<p>The men of the group soon observed
the flint knives and spear-heads used by
Longhead; they at once appreciated
their superior effectiveness as weapons,
and importuned him to supply them with
similar ones, or teach them how to make
them for themselves. He was now too
shrewd, however, to risk the loss of any
of his prestige by revealing the secret of
their manufacture, but agreed to make
them similar weapons for a consideration,
payment of which should be made
in the shape of food and fuel, the only
commodities at that time of any value.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Each man now brought him suitable
sticks for javelins and spears, and for
each he made a long spear, two javelins
and a knife.</p>

<p>When the first supply of flakes was
exhausted, Longhead heated another
nodule of flint and poured water on it
from a piece of bark, but he was careful
to do this when none of the others were
about; and thus maintained both secrecy
and a supply of materials.</p>

<p>The control of fire and the manufacture
of these valuable and mysterious
weapons, gave Longhead a standing in
the group which none had ever before
attained. Human society had not yet
been organized in any form; there were
no laws, no rules and no chiefs. Each
did exactly as he pleased, and if there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
any restraint at all upon a man's actions,
it came not from a sense of justice, morals
or ethics, but simply the fear of a beating
by the injured party, if any of his supposed
rights were infringed upon.</p>

<p>Soon, however, individuals began to
consult Longhead in regard to ordinary
affairs. One would ask him if there
would be rain during the day; another,
the direction he should take for a prosperous
hunt, and, as he was always careful
to make replies which were somewhat
vague and mysterious, except where he
had certain knowledge, he soon acquired
a reputation for superior wisdom.</p>

<p>Longhead, now relieved, to some extent,
from the daily exertion necessary to
procure food for himself and Broken
Tooth, by the contributions of many who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
through indolence or ignorance, permitted
their fires to become extinguished,
had much time for thought, and,
as he sat making weapons, the manufacture
of which brought him additional
supplies, it one day occurred to him that
if a number of the men armed with the
new weapons could be employed at the
same time against larger animals theretofore
always avoided, the people might
combat with them successfully and thus
the food supply might be largely increased.
This was the first suggestion of
coöperation, and the idea but slowly took
form in his mind, though it recurred to
him almost daily. Up to this time each
man had hunted alone, and if two or
more happened to be in company, it was
by the merest accident; but, as Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>head
worked out the problem, he concluded
that if a number could be directed
by an intelligent leader, their efforts
might be successful, and he determined
to make the experiment at the earliest
opportunity.</p>

<p>About this time a hunter returned one
afternoon in great excitement, and reported
that a large rhinoceros had partly
mired in a swamp near the settlement.
He said the huge animal was able to
make but little progress and might be
approached quite near without grave danger.
This was Longhead's opportunity
to try his experiment of coöperation.
Fortunately, there were quite a number
of the men about that day, and he at once
called them together, told them to bring
their weapons and accompany him to the
swamp. He assumed the leadership of
the party, and when they approached the
swamp, each was directed to gather a
bundle of dry grass, reeds and brush.
These he had thrown down as they progressed,
to give them footing in the soft
ooze, and soon they had a tolerably firm
path from the solid ground to a place
near the great beast. On their approach
the rhinoceros made no further attempt
at progress, but he turned his head with
its long sharp horn toward his foes and,
with loud snorts of rage, seemed to dare
them to come nearer. Their ancient fear
of this formidable animal made the men
hesitate, but under the peremptory orders
of Longhead, they ventured forward and
threw their javelins into the body of the
huge animal. It must be confessed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
for some time the attack seemed only to
increase his rage, he made vigorous efforts
to reach his tormentors and snorted
loudly. But while, for the most part, the
javelins did not penetrate beyond the
thick layer of fat which surrounded the
animal's body, a few had reached some of
the larger blood-vessels, and when these
were broken off or torn out in the desperate
struggles of the beast, the blood
poured forth in torrents and he soon began
to weaken; his snorting was no
longer so loud and he would lie down
occasionally as if to rest, closing his eyes
and breathing loudly but with evident
difficulty. During one of these resting
spells, Longhead came close to him and
thrust his long spear with all his might
into the animal's body just back of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
shoulder. When it was withdrawn, the
blood spouted from the wound and also
from the mouth of the beast, and soon its
eyes grew dim, its struggles grew less frequent
and violent, and finally ceased entirely,
for the great rhinoceros was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/i_097.jpg" width="368" height="534" alt="The great beast" />
<div class="caption">SOON THEY HAD A TOLERABLY FIRM PATH FROM THE
SOLID GROUND TO A PLACE NEAR THE GREAT BEAST.</div>
</div>

<p>Longhead now, for a while, lost control
of the situation. The men went
simply wild. Their shouts filled the air,
and to these were joined the shrill cries
of the women and children who had approached
the swamp and had been interested
witnesses of the battle and its result.
The great animal&mdash;an abundance of
food for several days&mdash;was theirs. They
had occasionally before this happened
upon the body of one of these animals,
killed in one of the fights which frequently
occurred between the males of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
the species, but, without knives, they had
been unable to tear the thick hide, and
even when it had been torn by wolves or
bears, the meat was so tough they were
able to obtain but a few small pieces.
Their present hilarity might certainly be
excused.</p>

<p>Soon Longhead began issuing orders
and enforcing them by punches with the
blunt end of his spear or sound blows
with the pole, and some semblance of
order was obtained. By his direction,
men, women and children joined in
bringing more brush and grass. This
was piled close to the carcass and the men
with their flint knives proceeded to cut
up the huge body. The women and children
carried loads of meat to the settlement,
and soon most of the flesh was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>moved.
The head was dragged by the
men to Longhead's cave and set upon a
stick on the platform as his trophy, while
all stood around and roused the echoes
of the ravine with their yells and acclamations,&mdash;the
first time a public acknowledgement
was ever given a leader.</p>

<p>Such feasting the group had never
known. At each fire, large pieces of
rhinoceros steak were roasted on coals or
sticks, and for several days, every man,
woman and child was literally too full
for utterance.</p>

<p>After this experience, Longhead, as
the organizer and leader of the coöperative
attack on the rhinoceros and the final
slayer of the animal, was, by common consent,
regarded as the head of the group;
his advice was sought on all occasions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
and his word was law. He gradually
assumed the direction of everything that
was done.</p>

<p>Having demonstrated the strength of
coöperative hunting, he organized easily
a squad of the bravest and most active of
the men as special hunters of large game.
Each was armed with a long spear, two
javelins and a knife, and he required
them to practice javelin throwing until
each became expert. On a hunt these
men always kept within hearing or sight
of each other, and they soon originated
a code of rude signals by which the whole
party might be informed of the appearance
of any large animal.</p>

<p>This band of hunters, on their first expedition,
led by Longhead in person,
encountered a drove of wild hogs. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
each man had hunted alone with stones
and clubs as his only weapons, these savage
creatures were almost as much
dreaded as the cave lion or the saber-tooth
tiger, and now when they appeared,
nearly every hunter, mindful of his old
fear, scrambled into a tree; but at Longhead's
command they descended, and he
organized them into a compact body,
back to back. When the hogs charged
in their usual manner, the slaughter
wrought by the spears and javelins was
so great that not an animal escaped, for,
in accordance with their habit, the hogs
knew nothing of retreat, and the last survivor
charged as bravely as if at the head
of the herd.</p>

<p>Again coöperation had triumphed, and
the settlement feasted for many days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>The genius for leadership shown by
Longhead, together with the superiority
of the weapons he had invented, and,
above all, his mysterious control of the
fire, had now firmly established him as
leader or chief, and none thought of questioning
his authority in anything. There
had been no election to the office, nor, indeed,
any consultation on the subject; he
simply assumed the leadership and the
group acquiesced by compliance with his
commands.</p>

<p>This first social organization for
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'cooperation' ">coöperation</ins>
in hunting&mdash;the germ from
which all governments and laws have
grown&mdash;was not the only one resulting
from the use of fire. The manifest blessings
or comforts due to its use, and the
mysterious manner of its production in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the fire-cave hidden from the sight of all,
began to give rise to the idea that Longhead
and Broken Tooth must be in communication
with some superior being.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that man at that time
had any religion, any conception of a god,
or indeed, any definite idea of supernatural
beings, but there were many mysteries
of nature which he could in no wise
comprehend. Incapable of speculative
thought, or, indeed, of much continuous
thought of any kind, he was unable to distinguish
clearly between the animate and
inanimate; he attributed active life to all
surrounding objects and believed even the
trees and plants to put on foliage, blossom
and produce fruit because they desired
to do so. When a rock, loosened by
the action of frost and storm, became detached
  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from a cliff and rolled into the
valley below, it did so of its own accord
and was regarded with fear. A man
would make a wide circuit to avoid it in
passing and none would voluntarily approach
it. They lived in a region of
cliffs and mountains and when one gave
a shout, under proper conditions, his
words were repeated, sometimes more
than once; and none could find the mysterious
beings who did the mocking; indeed,
after vain searches, they became
convinced that the tantalizing mockings
came from beings invisible to man, consequently
his superiors and, therefore,
dangerous. They began to avoid the
glens and valleys wherein echoes
abounded, or, if compelled to pass
through them, did so in silence that their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
dangerous neighbors might not be provoked
to do them an injury. The curling
mist rolling silently down the mountain
side, was to them another mysterious
being of whom they stood in awe,
and thunder, lightning and storm each
became to them personified and living
supernatural beings who terrified them.
They had yet no belief that man had a
soul or spirit which existed after his
death. This thought was to come ages
thereafter.</p>

<p>It was not long until it was suggested
that Longhead must have subjected to his
control one or more powerful but invisible
beings whom he kept shut up in his
cave under the guardianship of the
woman, and who, at his command, produced
the fire and wonderful weapons.
That Broken Tooth was the guardian of
these beings, made mystery attach to her
as well, and they began to look upon her
with fear and reverence also. The man
and woman encouraged this by becoming
more mysterious than ever. When
further questioned in regard to the fire,
they boldly asserted that the whispered
stories were true; that their control of
fire and the ability on the part of the
man to make superior weapons was due
to supernatural beings who frequented
the cave and were subject to them. They
asserted that these beings were so powerful
they could strike them all with instant
death, and would have done so but for
the intercession of the fire-man and the
woman to whose control they were subject;
but the people were assured that so
long as Longhead and Broken Tooth
should be treated with proper respect,
their wants satisfied and their commands
obeyed, they would not permit these
malevolent beings to molest any of the
group, and the fire should not be taken
away.</p>

<p>Soon the people of the group at the
fire-cave were informed that the fire-spirits
desired the man to remain most
of the time at or near the cave that they
might converse with him at all times and
instruct him in additional methods for
promoting the happiness and welfare of
the people, and it would, therefore, be
impossible for him to take part in the
daily hunt for game, though he would
still lead them in important expeditions.
On this account he directed that each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
member of the group should daily bring
to the fire-cave contributions of food, sufficient
not only for the wants of the man,
but of the woman and spirits also. The
people readily believed this, for they
were incapable of conceiving that such
beings as spirits had not need of material
food, and, consequently, each brought his
or her offering daily, either of food or
fuel. If by reason of failure in the chase,
an unfortunate hunter had no offering to
bring, he was required to come to the
cave and, through the medium of Longhead,
ask pardon of the spirits, and bring
a double portion the next time.</p>

<p>To all this the people of the group
readily submitted; Longhead and
Broken Tooth lived in comfort, if not in
luxury, without any effort upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
part; the people were educated to ask
the forgiveness of superior and supernatural
beings whose existence was
shrouded in mystery, through the medium
of a priest whose natural wants
they were required to supply; and thus
a religious worship with a dedicated and
supported priesthood, if not a religion
itself, was established among men.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<span class="smaller">DAWN OF INVENTION, ART, MARRIAGE,
RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT</span></h2>


<p>Affairs at the settlement near the
fire-cave now moved along smoothly.
Their new weapons enabled the hunters
to secure abundance of food in a country
teeming with animal life, now that they
dared attack the larger animals. Cooking
made both the flesh and vegetables
more nourishing as well as more appetizing,
and soon the enormous stomachs,
no longer continually distended with raw
and indigestible food, became reduced in
size and their bodies less unwieldy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Made confident by the use of fire and
superior weapons, the men now walked
fully erect and wandered through the
forest with little fear. As their supply of
nourishing food increased, more children
were born than before, and the mortality
among infants was greatly reduced. All
this tended toward a rapid increase of
population in the settlement. This increase
in the population necessitated more
habitations, and this, at the time meant
more caves, for this was the epoch of
cave-men. After all the available caves
in the ravine and vicinity had been appropriated,
an enterprising young man
of the group who, by reason of mutual
attachment and because of the example,
perhaps, of Longhead and Broken Tooth,
had induced a young woman to establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
similar relations with him, being unable
to find an unoccupied cave, concluded to
establish housekeeping upon a horizontal
ledge overhung by a projecting rocky
cliff. This location, protected only in
the rear, soon proved to be too exposed
for comfort, and the couple concluded to
improve it. They took several good sized
sticks of different lengths which had been
burned off by the fires and after leaning
them up against the sloping rock, piled
on brush and grass. This was much better
than the open front, but a coal from
their fire having blown into the grass
after it had dried, caused a conflagration
which reduced them to their former condition.
The man proved to be quite intelligent,
and he began to select logs of
the same length, burning them off at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
proper place when necessary; and these
they sloped up side by side at the front as
before, but, mindful of the fire, they filled
the interstices with sticks, stones and moss,
finally plastering the whole front, except
for a small opening for entrance, with
mud. This was a great improvement
over all former conditions; the rain and
wind were excluded, to a considerable
extent; indeed, it was preferable to a
cave. It was lighter and better ventilated,
and, when they had learned to
construct movable frames which could be
securely fastened in the doorways, to prevent
incursions by wild animals, these
lean-tos or rock-shelters, the remains of
which have been found in many parts of
Europe, became the favorite habitations
of the people of the group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>The inhabitants of the caves and rock-shelters
did not clean house every spring
and fall, or, indeed, at any other time;
the refuse and debris of the household
were allowed to accumulate upon the
floors of the caves and rock-shelters, and
to this we owe nearly all the knowledge
possessed by civilized man of the domestic
arts, weapons, food, etc., and the general
conditions under which the cave-men
lived, as well as of the animals which
were their contemporaries. The floors of
these ancient dwellings, when excavated
by scientists, show several feet of debris
or accumulations, which are called
"brecchia," being a conglomeration of
dirt, bones of animals, bones of human
beings, weapons, implements and other
artifacts, which are frequently cemented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
with limestone formations caused by the
drippings of the rocks and caves, in the
nature of stalactites and stalagmites.</p>

<p>Not only have we learned from this
"brecchia" what progress the cave-men
had made in domestic art, but our knowledge
of the animals which lived in the
locality and were their contemporaries is
almost wholly derived from rude pictures
made by these cave people, who
seem to have suddenly developed an artistic
sense and made such pictures by etching
or scratching them with sharp flints
upon pieces of bone, ivory and slate.
These drawings are by no means so crude
and wanting in artistic skill as we would
be inclined to expect. The animals depicted
are readily recognizable; such
drawings show groups of reindeer, now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
found only in the arctic regions; the wild
horse; the single horned rhinoceros; the
giant elk; and on a smooth piece of his
own tusk, we see the curved-tusked, hairy
elephant of gigantic size&mdash;the mammoth,
or <i>elephas primigenius</i>, whose
bones have been found in many parts of
Europe and Asia, and of which at least
one specimen was found whole with the
flesh intact, in the frozen tundra of Siberia.
But for these drawings&mdash;the
natural history of his time&mdash;left by
cave-men, we would not know that immense
animals, now long extinct in Europe,
had contested with men of the cave
period, the ownership of the forests,
swamps, plains and mountains.</p>

<p>In the "brecchia" of these caves, are
often found long bones of animals which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
have been split longitudinally to obtain
the marrow, which was regarded as a
great delicacy by primitive man; and as
some long bones of the human body have
been found split in the same manner,
some scientists have concluded that cave
men were cannibals, or at least occasionally
made a feast upon the bodies of prisoners
captured in war, or upon such sacrifices
when offered to the gods.</p>

<p>At the time when rock-shelters became
favorite habitations of the people at the
fire-cave, marriage relations were still
loose, and any idea of male parentage was
yet to come, but in a few generations, instead
of accepting the birth of children
without thought, it was generally believed
that the supernatural beings with
whom their imaginations peopled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
hills, valleys, groves and ravines, were responsible
for their advent. However, the
more frequent and intimate association of
the sexes around the fires and in preparing
food by roasting, had a great effect,
and it was noticeable that men and
women began to pair off in the caves and
rock-shelters; that such cohabitation continued
for longer periods of time, and
there were a number who appeared to
have formed permanent unions. There
was something about the fire&mdash;the social
hearthstone&mdash;which tended to prolong
such associations. The cheerful light of
the fires; the measure of comfort they
furnished, and the talkativeness promoted
by companionship as the hunters related
around the evening fires the adventures
and experiences of that and former days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
all combined to make man more of a
social being, and the same influences promoted
more permanency of union between
couples who found themselves at
all congenial.</p>

<p>Perhaps the example of Longhead and
Broken Tooth, who had remained true
to each other, had something to do with
this gradual change in the relations of
the sexes, but it was not until many generations
after when the fact of male
parentage became known to mankind,
that anything at all like marriage was
known or any man regarded any child
or children as his own. There being no
settled custom in this matter, many
couples continued to unite and separate
as they might feel inclined. The most
that can be said is, that the use of fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
in some manner appeared to promote a
longer union than was common before
its discovery, and that, in the progress of
ages, fire seems to have been one of the
agencies which greatly assisted in bringing
about the present sacredness of home
and marriage.</p>

<p>The hunters of the group still continued
their coöperative search for food,
and the fact that it was often impossible
to determine who had killed a particular
animal, while it was frequently certain
that the weapons and efforts of several
had a part in it, brought about a system
for making an equitable distribution of
all the animals taken in each expedition.
First the share required by Longhead
and Broken Tooth would be set apart,
then the remainder was apportioned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
each member of the group or to each
habitation in proportion to the number of
persons to be supported.</p>

<p>The women, too, whose task it was to
find the roots and vegetables, eggs, berries
and nuts which entered into their
diet, began to imitate the actions of the
men in this respect. They soon arranged
to leave the older and more feeble women
at the settlement to maintain the fires and
look after the younger children, and to
these was allotted a share of the food secured
by the others.</p>

<p>These customs were established gradually
and without definite enactments, or
even agreements, but by common consent;
they were, however, greatly promoted by
Longhead, who seemed to make coöperation
a sort of a hobby. They seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
have just happened, but they were, in
fact, the natural outgrowth of fire and
the changed conditions due to its influence.
In the course of years these customs
crystallized into a communal organization
in which all things, except perhaps,
the weapons of a hunter and a very
few personal belongings upon which the
owner had expended thought and labor,
were regarded as the property of the
group or tribe. This communal organization
of society continued for thousands
of years and its vestiges still exist amid
the highest enlightenment, as the foundation
for business corporations, partnerships,
and, indeed, all commercial and
other coöperation,&mdash;communism&mdash;the
greatest good to the greatest number, being
the basis of all civilized laws.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>While the hunters of the settlement at
the fire-cave scoured the forest for animal
food, and the women sought vegetables,
nuts, berries and eggs, Longhead was by
no means idle. True, he was, by the contributions
exacted from the group, relieved
from the necessity of daily effort
to secure sustenance for himself, Broken
Tooth and a bright-eyed little cave-boy
who had been sent to the woman by the
spirits, and he seldom joined in a hunting
excursion; but, weapons were often
broken or lost, and, as he still retained
the secret of their manufacture, he was
kept tolerably busy in replacing them.
Continual experience in this work gave
him greater skill and a truer eye for symmetry
of form coupled with effectiveness
for use, and he also learned to distinguish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the best materials of the vicinage. He
invented no new weapons, for the bow
and arrow and even the stone axe, were
to be the products of a much later epoch;
but he discovered that a javelin could be
thrown with much greater accuracy if the
two sides of the flint point were exactly
alike and evenly balanced. Experience
had also demonstrated to him that the
weapon had greater penetrative force if
the flake for the flint head was thin and
the edges and point very sharp. He became
more careful, therefore, in the selection
of his flakes, and when he found
one suitable for his use, except one side
was larger than the other or the edges too
thick, he found that he could batter off
small pieces with light blows of a pebble,
or flake them by pressure with a bone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and thus bring it into shape. He discovered
also that when the base of a flake
had some notches near it, the fastenings
remained more firm and the point was
less likely to become detached from the
shaft. He therefore began, by pecking
and flaking, to form such notches where
he did not find them to suit him, and soon
his spear and javelin heads assumed a
conventional form. There was a slow but
continuous improvement in the weapons
of the period, but eventually these spear
and
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: variant spelling from original text">knive</ins>
heads became much like those
still found upon the village sites of primitive
man all over the world.</p>

<p>The worst trouble Longhead had to
overcome in the manufacture of weapons
was the method of fastening the points to
the shafts or handles. The small fibrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
roots he used at first would fray and
break when they became dry, and the
points would be lost or fail the hunter at
a critical moment. The stringy bark he
cut from trees with his knife was little
better, but, one day when cutting up a
large animal for cooking, he found its
hide so tough he could hardly penetrate it
with the knife, an idea occurred to him,
and he cut off a long narrow strip of the
skin for an experiment. This he hung up
until he should have time to make the test
he had in mind, and when he came to try
it he found that he could not break it
even by exerting all his strength. From
the skin of the next animal that came into
his larder, he secured a number of long
strips, and, having dried these, he wet
them to make them more pliable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
used some of them in lashing a point to a
javelin. This weapon he tested by frequent
use, and was pleased to note that
the new lashing did not fray or break
when it became dry, nor did it loosen,
but, on the contrary, the strings of rawhide
shrank when drying and held the
point the tighter. Thereafter the tough
hides were removed, dried and prepared
for strings for this and other purposes,
and it was not long until he accidentally
discovered that wet wood ashes placed
on a skin for a few hours would loosen
the hair and permit its removal, leaving
the skin improved for making strings.</p>

<p>About this time Broken Tooth made a
discovery and, like the others, it was also
accidental. In her cooking operations,
pieces of food were continually falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
upon the ground or being laid upon it
in course of preparation, and they became
more or less covered with sand or
fine particles of grit, which did not taste
good, and, besides, they hurt her teeth.
She had no idea of their uncleanliness;
it was simply a matter of discomfort.
One day she observed a long strip of
bark hanging to a tree which had recently
blown over, and the idea occurred
to her that if she had some pieces of this
bright, clean bark on which to place the
food, the disagreeable sand might be
avoided. She tried to break the bark,
but it was too tough and stringy, so she
went to the cave and returned with a
flake of flint. It happened to have a
sharp but very ragged edge, and she
found that by drawing the edge back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
forth across the grain of the bark and
at the same time putting on some pressure,
she could cut it rapidly. That evening
she surprised Longhead by presenting
his supper on a set of clean bark
dishes. The man examined them curiously
and asked how she had cut them.
She produced the flint and demonstrated
on one of the plates how it would cut.
She had invented, or at least, she had
made the first application of the saw.</p>

<p>The man examined the flake thoughtfully,
and, picking up a piece of stick,
tried it on that. He soon sawed it off,
and was greatly pleased. To get the
staves of his spears and handles of javelins
the right length, he had been burning
them off in the fire, but now he would
use a saw. He soon found that the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
numerous and regular the notches the
faster the implement would cut, and, as
few, if any, of the flakes came off the
nodules in this condition, he applied
pecking and pressure, and soon had a
saw with small and regular serrations or
teeth, and found it very useful.</p>

<p>Up to this time, all his knives had been
made of long flakes with a wrapping of
roots at one end to protect the hand, but
he had found it difficult to secure many
flakes long enough for both blade and
handle. One day he had the misfortune
to break the shaft of his favorite spear.
It had a thin blade which was very long
and sharp, and the rawhide strings held
it firmly. He attempted to untie the
lashings, that he might use the blade for
another shaft, but they had become so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
hard and dry that he could not succeed
in untying them. He picked up his saw
to cut them, but first began idly to draw
it across the shaft. At once he noticed
that if cut off at the point where he was
sawing, the spear would become a knife
with a wooden handle. The operation
was quickly completed, and he found the
new style of knife much superior to the
old. Flakes of this size were much more
frequently produced in breaking a
nodule with fire and water, and all his
knives were thereafter furnished with
wooden handles.</p>

<p>The saw thus became one of the most
useful of his few tools. Thus the flint
saw, discovered by accident by a primitive
woman, was the germ from which
has been elaborated, with little change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
except for material, one of the most useful
tools known to civilized man.</p>

<p>When the little cave-boy of their family
was something over a year old, a small
girl was brought by the spirits, and as
the children grew and thrived, Broken
Tooth began to suggest that their present
home was becoming crowded. The cave
was indeed a small one for two, three
made it uncomfortable, and now four
was certainly a crowd. Longhead first
proposed searching for a cave of larger
proportions, but to this Broken Tooth
raised several objections. All the larger
caves in the vicinity were already occupied,
and, while they might no doubt use
the authority of the spirits to compel the
present occupants to vacate a cave for
their use, this course was sure to create<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
ill feeling which, sooner or later, might
work to their disadvantage; and, besides,
where could they find one with so large
a platform in front and so well protected
by overhanging rock. Could not some
plan be devised to enlarge this one? and
she called Longhead's attention to the
fact that the rock inside was soft and
friable, and that small pieces were continually
falling down, which she carried
out and threw over the edges of the platform.</p>

<p>The man undertook to make the cavity
larger by pulling down and removing all
the loose pieces, but, when this was done,
little increase in the size of their home
was apparent. On one side the man noticed
that the rock was full of small
cracks and seams, but these were so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
tightly fitted and irregular that he could
remove but few of the stones with his
hands. One piece that was quite loose he
tried for a long time to pull out, but it
pinched too tightly at one corner. In a
rage, he picked up a large, sharp cornered
piece of flint with both hands and
struck it with all his might into the crack
which held the tightest. The piece that
bound it was broken and the stone fell
out, followed by a number of others.
Another discovery of the value of flint
pieces had been made&mdash;a pick had been
found, and daily both Longhead and
Broken Tooth spent some hours digging
at the loosened rocks until, in the course
of time, they had a cave sufficiently large
for their needs, and in succeeding years
this was extended, as the growth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
family and their ideas of comfort demanded.</p>

<p>By the same means Longhead removed
the irregularities of the floor and side
walls, and finally he somewhat enlarged
the doorway, gave it a more regular
shape, and substituted strong wooden
bars, held in place by notches cut in the
stone, for the large stones they had formerly
rolled into the opening at night to
prevent the entrance of dangerous animals.
The curious inhabitants of the settlement
watched these operations, and it
was not long until many other caves were
thus enlarged and more comfort secured.</p>

<p>During the remainder of Longhead's

the manufacture of weapons and implements,

of the group; but the flint saw became
a common implement and was applied
to various uses; many of the families
used bark dishes, and a sort of rude
basket had been evolved from naturally
curled cylinders of bark into which a bottom
of bark or interlacing of rawhide
strings had been inserted. These were
used to transport nuts, berries, wild fruit,
eggs, etc., to the caves and as receptacles
in which to retain the same afterwards.
No basketry or other weaving process
had been thought of, nor had there been
any attempt made to manufacture or use
any kind of clothing, the skins of animals
being used only for strings, or occasionally
to carry food products.</p>

<p>Social conditions also remained practically
the same, but food was more easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
procured in consequence of slowly extending
coöperation, and the method of
its preparation by cooking made it more
nourishing, consequently more of the
children grew to manhood and womanhood,
and the average of life was longer.
The possession of effective weapons continued
to render men less fearful, they
became more and more erect and grew
to a taller stature.</p>

<p>The inventions and improvement in
conditions already described were the
necessary and almost immediate results
of the control and use of fire, and when
this point was reached, further progress
for many generations can scarcely have
been considerable. Primitive man was
not fertile in original ideas, nor inventive,
except from accident aided by necessity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
and the use of the bow and arrow,
stone axe, baskets, weaving and pottery
were to come many generations after the
death of Longhead, Broken Tooth and
their fellows of the fire-cave settlement.
A method for producing fire by friction
of wood upon wood, after the method of
the fire-drill, which has been common to
nearly all primitive peoples who have
come under the observation of civilized
men, probably came with the other later
discoveries, but it was doubtless still
longer before any clothing was used, and
then, at first, it was most likely more for
ornament than for comfort or any feeling
of modesty.</p>

<p>However, the succeeding generations
of the group described never lost the inventions
of Longhead, and in after ages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
when the idea of a Supreme Being or
beings had been elaborated as a religion,
he was deified and worshipped as a god
and the founder of the tribe or people.</p>

<p>The descendants of Broken Tooth&mdash;for
descent for many ages was still reckoned
only in the female line&mdash;continued
to be the weapon-makers and rulers of
the tribe, and from them were the fire-priests
always selected, when the worship
of fire, with a consecrated priesthood and
a more or less elaborate ritual, had been
developed.</p>

<p>Many ages were to pass with a slow
but continued upward progress before
this group of fire-people entered even
the lowest stages of barbarism, but certainly
the discovery of the use and control
of fire had much to do with the early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
progress of the rude people described,
and whose individuals, we have assumed
for the purposes of the story, were our
own far away ancestors.</p>

<p>A big and purposeful story interwoven about the responsibilities
and problems in the medical profession of the present
day. Dr. Weaver, a noted specialist, and head of a private
hospital, had allowed himself to drift away from the standards
of his youth in his desire for wealth and social and scientific
prestige. When an exposé of the methods employed by
him in furthering his schemes for the glorifying of the name
of "Weaver" in the medical world is threatened, it is frustrated
through the efforts of the famous doctor's younger
brother, Dr. Jim. The story is powerful and compelling,
even if it uncovers the problems and temptations of a physician's
career. Perhaps the most important character, not
even excepting Dr. Weaver and Dr. Jim, is "The Girl," who
plays such an important part in the lives of both men.</p>

<p>When Joy Kent finds herself alone in the world, thrown
on her own resources, after the death of her father, she looks
about her, as do so many young girls, fresh from the public
schools, wondering how she can support herself and earn a
place in the great business world about her. Still wondering,
she sends a letter to a number of girls she had known in school
days, asking that each one tell her just how she had equipped
herself for a salary-earning career, and once equipped, how
she had found it possible to start on that career. In reply
come letters from the milliner, the stenographer, the librarian,
the salesgirl, the newspaper woman, the teacher, the nurse,
and from girls who had adopted all sorts of vocations as a
means of livelihood. Real

young mother, the heroine of the story, when the child's
sight is restored. There is a time for rejoicing, too, when
a lost will is found, bringing wealth and release from all
worries, and the young mother is free to accept the love and
protection that in her sorrow she denied herself.</p>

<p>The reading public is no longer content with the old
hackneyed love story, the impossible mystery story or the
superficial tale of adventure. It is necessary that a novel
to be successful shall appeal to the best in us&mdash;shall grip
our hearts and fill our thoughts. Few first books by a new
writer can supply such an exacting demand, but "John O'
Partletts'" is among these few. Its simple, straightforward
plot; its able and convincing portrayal of character&mdash;real
character; the author's mastery of her art&mdash;these are
the elements which make the book worthy of wide appreciation.
No one character dominates the story, neither
"Witch" Beevish, the eccentric old woman at war with the
village, nor Jim, the little orphan, nor Henry Carruthers,
the minister, nor even Kitty Merryweather, the shrewd-tongued
gossip. But if there is a hero it is John O' Partletts',
"Witch" Beevish's great dog, the friend and protector
of Little Jim.</p>

<p>This is a story to compare with "Rab and His Friends"
